                    <i>
                        This novel is a primer on dealing with garden gnomes in fun and innovative ways. It has been heralded as 
                        one of the most forward-thinking treatises on the matter and, according to the world's leading gnome pundits 
                        (excluding myself, the most qualified of all, of course), has directly contributed to the Stinger's invention.
                        <br> 
                        Addendum: It is with great pleasure that I announce the third edition has been translated into Greek, Swiss, Arabic, 
                        Vietnamese, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and, for whatever reason, Latin.

                    <i>
                        You don't need cauldrons, spells, and suspicious glances from voyeurs to practice your magic. Why not use 
                        what is already accessible? Ants are available everywhere; as such, they are the best things to practice on.
                        This is the perfect entry into entomancy, insect enchantment, and team management (albeit with coersion).

                    <i>
                        Peering into the future is one of the most salient parts of magic. But just <strong>how</strong>
                        is one to do so? Enter my novel. With beginner exercises and orb recommendations, you will soon join the ranks 
                        of acclaimed clairvoyants across history (though whether or not you'll be remembered is irrelevant and, sadly, 
                        quite unlikely). Start small with tomorrow's weather forecast. Move on to bigger things like employment opportunities. 
                        Lastly, entertain yourself with perfect bets on sports events. Dare to see which monarchs will live forever!

                            future.</a> I do not claim any irresponsibility for the inevitable fallout coinciding with your ungovernable curiosity.
